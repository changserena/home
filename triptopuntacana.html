<h1>Trip to Punta Cana</h1>
<h2>New Years in Punta Cana</h2>
<p>Celebrating New Years at Bahia Principe Bavaro in Punta Cana is a very different experience then my regular New Years routine at a friends house. The hotel was 
decorated nicely for the Christmas holidays as well as new years. Our first meal in Punta Cana was a special new years dinner that was delicious. The restaurant 
was decorated for all the festivities that were about to happen and there was a party that included a dance show and fireworks. The hotel had hats and noisemakers 
for all and the disco was quite busy that night for the New Years countdown.</p>
<h2>Exploring the Resort</h2>
<p>Since we were staying for a week we had plenty of  time to relax and go to excursions. Although the beach was very crowded the view was spectacular, all the palm trees, 
the whitish sand and the sound of the waves hitting the shore. The good thing about resorts are that there is unlimited food that you can take all around the resort. The service was 
impeccable as they were bring you drinks without you needing to move from your seat. The resort was also impeccably large after walking around, there were golf cards everywhere you 
looked driving people to the beach, the lobby and their living area. Unlike Canada, when it was -15&#176 C, it was surpassing 25&#176 C in Punta Cana and was unbearably hot. The food 
there was amazing too, each restaurant had different culture's food </p>
<h2>Dolphin Explorer</h2>
<p>In Punta Cana, there is alot of marine life in the ocean but also at discovery centers. We went to the Dolphin Discovery center to learn about dolphins and ride and play with them. 
It was an experience of a lifetime getting to even touch a dolphin. The dolphins were so cute and obedient it was truly an unforgettable memory. We also went to a four package boat that 
provided kayaking, paddle-boarding, snorkeling, massages, swimming with sharks and stingrays and power-snorkeling. It was a 4 hour excursion that allowed us to do any of the activities
we wanted. All the stingray tails were cut off so that it would be safe to touch and the sharks didn't have teeth to bite you but the best part was that there was unlimited food on board
that we could take. </p>
